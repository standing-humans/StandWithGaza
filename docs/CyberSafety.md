    * Use a trusted VPN (Virtual Private Network) to mask your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic.
    * Consider using the Tor Browser for enhanced anonymity.

4. **Be Wary of Phishing and Malware:**
    * Be cautious of suspicious emails, links, and attachments.
    * Keep your software and devices up to date with the latest security patches.
    * Use a reliable antivirus and anti-malware solution.

5. **Social Media Security:**
    * Review your privacy settings on all social media platforms.
    * Be mindful of the information you share publicly.
    * Be aware of doxxing and online harassment campaigns.
