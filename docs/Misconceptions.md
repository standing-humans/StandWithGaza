# Common Misconceptions about Gaza

This page aims to address some common misconceptions about the situation in Gaza.

---

Claim: **The conflict is a "war between two equal sides."**  
⛔️ False. This framing ignores the vast power imbalance between Israel, a nuclear-armed state with one of the world's most advanced militaries, and the Palestinians in Gaza, who have no army, navy, or air force. Gaza is a besieged territory, and its people are living under a 17-year blockade.

Claim: **The issue is too complicated to understand.**  
⛔️ While the history is long, the current situation is not as complicated as it's often made out to be. It is a humanitarian crisis rooted in decades of occupation, displacement, and the denial of basic human rights to the Palestinian people.

---

Claim: **This is a religious conflict between Jews and Muslims.**  
⛔️ False. This is a political conflict over land, resources, and self-determination. Framing it as a religious war is a dangerous oversimplification that erases the political and historical context. Many Jewish people around the world, including in Israel, stand in solidarity with Palestinians.

---

Claim: **All Palestinians in Gaza are members of Hamas.**  
⛔️ False. Hamas is a political party that governs the Gaza Strip. The vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are civilians, and more than half of them are children. It is a violation of international law to collectively punish an entire population for the actions of its government.

Claim: **Israel has a right to defend itself.**  
International law grants a state the right to self-defense, but it does not grant an occupying power the right to use military force against the people it occupies. Furthermore, the principle of proportionality in international law dictates that a state's response must be commensurate with the threat it faces. The scale of destruction and civilian casualties in Gaza has been widely condemned as disproportionate.
